I am a software engineer interested in the architectures of high-performance
number crunching with Python. Specifically, I am interested in low-level
aspects such interfacing Python with C code, strategies for efficient memory
allocation, avoiding redundant memory copies and exploiting the memory
hierarchy for accelerated computation. Occasionally, I flirt with
machine-learning.

In the past I have worked on psychophysics data analysis, large scale brain
simulations, analytical engines for business intelligence and large-scale
data-center monitoring. I wrote a book about using the Git version control
system and have contributed to a diverse selection of over 50 open source
projects. I currently reside in Berlin and  work as a freelance software
engineer and consultant.
